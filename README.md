# Bachelor Thesis Howest

A thesis that answers the question "How to Reduce the Time Needed to Create Firing Ranges?". During this research a proof of concept API was created which automatically creates a virtual network environment using VMware vSphere according to a given scenario.

My internship at [NVISO](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity) Frankfurt led to the creation of this thesis.
